# TextEdit

This is my first gtk4-rs application which I made as a learning exercise.
I developed a simple text editor in Rust using Gnome Builder IDE.
I did this with the goal of learning both GTK, and how to build desktop
GUI software, using the Rust programming language.

## Learning Resources

To learn gtk4-rs I used the following resources:

- Rust GTK Overview: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W2cJ42iiJs
- gtk4-rs Book: https://gtk-rs.org/gtk4-rs/git/book/
- gtk4-rs Github: https://github.com/gtk-rs/gtk4-rs
- Glade Tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmMgHNtOIstZEvqYJncYUx52n8_OV0uWy
